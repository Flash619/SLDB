SLDB Base Class
---------------

Here is an outline of the core functions within the *SLDB* main class. Every interaction with the database will be handled by the *SLDB* main class/object.

.. class:: SLDB

	.. method:: __construct(array $config=array())

	.. method:: select(string $table, array $fields, array $where)
				select(string $table, array $fields, array $where, integer $limit)

	.. method:: insert(string $table, array $row)

	.. method:: update(string $table, array $where, array $values)
				update(string $table, array $where, array $values, integer $limit)

	.. method:: delete(string $table, array $where)
				delete(string $table, array $where, integer $limit)


Query Concepts
--------------

When deciding how to structure queries, SLDB tries to make it as natural feeling as possible. This being said, typically the order of arguments passed to a *query function* is *table*, *fields*, *where*, and *limit*. Aditional arguments may be used or required depending on the target result. For this article, we are going to go over basic query structure as well as a few aditional arguments you may use. This article does not cover *join* or *union* as these are on the advanced queryes page.

Queries are initialized by a call to a *query function* within the *SLDB Object*. Most basic queries will use *query functions* that are named after the queries primary operator or command. Basic queries such as select, insert, delete, and update can be called by their corresponding *query functions*. Basic *query functions* are outlined below.
